# 🕵️‍♂️ Fake Job Post Detection  

A full-stack machine learning application to detect fraudulent job listings using Kaggle’s dataset, XGBoost, DeepSeek, Playwright scraping, and a **React + Flask** architecture.  

## 📌 Overview  
It is a smart solution that detects fake job postings, helping job seekers and platforms avoid scams. It leverages machine learning models and NLP to classify job posts as genuine or fraudulent based on various features.

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Fake Job Postings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)  
- **Size**: ~17,800 listings  
- **Imbalance**: Only 4.84% labeled as fake  
- **Columns**: 18 features (job title, description, salary, department, etc.).  

### Missing Value Strategy  
| Column              | Missing (%) |  
|---------------------|-------------|  
| Department          | 64.5%       |  
| Salary Range        | 84%         |  
| Company Profile     | 18.5%       |  
| Benefits            | 40%         |  
| Required Education  | 45%         |  

Missing values were replaced with `"Not Provided"` or encoded appropriately.

## � Data Preprocessing  
- **Encoding**: Ordinal (ordered categories) + One-Hot (unordered).  
- **Feature Engineering**: Description length, salary range difference, binary flags.  
- **Balancing**: Hybrid sampling (undersampled real + oversampled fake jobs).  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (34 components).

## 🤖 Model - XGBoost  
Best results after testing Logistic Regression and handling multicollinearity (VIF).  

| Metric     | Value    |  
|------------|----------|  
| Accuracy   | 88.08%   |  
| Precision  | 0.94 (Real), 0.85 (Fake) |  
| Recall     | 0.85 (Real), 0.94 (Fake) |  
| F1-Score   | 0.89 (Real), 0.90 (Fake) |  

✅ **Improvement**: Dropping the "Industry" column boosted validation accuracy.

## 🧠 DeepSeek NLP Integration  
- Enhances predictions by analyzing job descriptions semantically.  

---

## 🌐 Web Scraping with Playwright  
- **Purpose**: Real-time scraping of job portals for live classification.  
- **Implementation**: Playwright automates browser-based extraction.
